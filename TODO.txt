* RMW instructions
* RInterlocked
* Example lock-free algorithms, once RMW working 
* Seq cst fence
* Condition variable (RMonitor)
* Left/Right RelaExample
* Exhaustive scheduler (clean up TestEnvironment before this)
* Restrict MemoryOrdered to atomic types (i.e. int/long + exception on construction?) or do at R-API level?
