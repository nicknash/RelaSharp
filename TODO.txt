* Left/Right RelaExample: Interesting invariants / verifications?
* Finish RMonitor 
* Finish RInterlocked
* Implement a CLR+x86-TSO mode?
* Review how RMW ops + Relaxed (especially, but other MOs too) are specified in C++11 vs. how my impl behaves.
* Progress / interruptibility.
* scheduler Yield/Back off
* Review Seq cst fence
* Place OnBegin/OnFinished on threads (with seq cst fences?) rather than current weirdness?
* More Example lock-free algorithms: Michael-Scott two-lock queue, bounded SPMC/MPMC, CRQ/LCRQ, Fetch-Add Queue.  
* Add Invariant() feature
* Exhaustive scheduler (clean up TestEnvironment before this)
* Restrict MemoryOrdered to atomic types (i.e. int/long/ref type + exception on construction?) or do at R-API level?
* Perf. optimizations. 
* Multi-threaded test runner?
* Interesting statistics?
