* RInterlocked
* Example lock-free algorithms: Treiber, Michael-Scott, bounded SPMC?  
* Seq cst fence
* Condition variable (RMonitor)
* Deadlock detection
* Left/Right RelaExample
* Exhaustive scheduler (clean up TestEnvironment before this)
* Restrict MemoryOrdered to atomic types (i.e. int/long/ref type + exception on construction?) or do at R-API level?
